## 📰 RSS Feed Reader

To demonstrate the RSS feed functionality, you can use the following link in any feed reader:

👉 **[RSS Feed Link](https://sport-spaces-aa524.web.app/news.xml)** 👈

### How it works:
1. Copy the RSS feed link: `https://sport-spaces-aa524.web.app/news.xml`.
2. Paste it into your preferred RSS feed reader (e.g., Feedly, Inoreader, or any browser extension).
3. The feed will display a list of news items. Each item links to a specific news article hosted on the app deployed in Firebase.
   - Example URL: `https://sport-spaces-aa524.web.app/news/article-id`.

### Screenshot:
Below is a screenshot of the RSS feed reader displaying the feed items. Each item links to the corresponding news article in the app.
